- **RLS Policies**: Some operations require admin authentication due to Row Level Security
- **Next.js Warnings**: Some pre-existing ESLint warnings for useEffect dependencies

## Migration Instructions
To enable full blog functionality with draft/published support:
1. Apply the database migration: `supabase/migrations/20240107000001_add_post_published_status.sql`
2. Re-enable published filtering in blog queries
3. Update BlogPostForm to include publishing options
